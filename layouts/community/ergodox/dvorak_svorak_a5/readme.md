# ErgoDox EZ Svorak A5 

This layout is supposed to be an implementation of the [Svorak A5
layout](http://aoeu.info/s/dvorak/svorak). Unfortunately, the Ergodox EZ lacks
one column for the right hand, why the three buttons furthest to the right, on
the right half, are missing. I have tried to move them around and have yet to
find a perfect position for them.

## Flashing

In order to compile and flash your Ergodox EZ, invoke the following at the root
of the repository.

`make ergodox_ez:dvorak_svorak_a5:teensy`
